# Tragic Solitude

Tragic Solitude (TS. Halo AI names are my go-to names for projects, apparently!) is a CS:GO cheat written in C++. This project serves as a means to slowly learn C++ and explore an area that has interested me for many years.

I do not support or endorse cheating in games, i am just interested in exploring the area and learning new skills.

## Features
As of initial commit:
- Glow ESP (Other players and teammates have a glow outline, achieved by writing values to game memory to enable a pre-existing game feature)
- Wallhack (Other players and teammates have a box drawn around them showing their location, achieved by retriving 3d matrix of each player, converting to 2d and using GDI to draw a box)

## Notes
- TS makes use of the SlimMem RPM/WPM class with plans to write my own in the future.
- The above class will not be included on this repository to avoid this cheat being easily compilable for others.
- TS is a WIP and will advance alongside my knowledge of C++, which as of writing is basic.
- Tutorials on game memory manipulation from various sources have been used during the development process.
